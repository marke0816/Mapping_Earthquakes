# Mapping_Earthquakes

This repository and its branches provide many examples of GeoJSON data visualization using Leaflet and the Mapbox API.  

The Earthquake_Challenge folder contains scripts for visualizations of earthquake data for the past 7 days with layers for tectonic plate boundaries, all earthquakes for the past seven days, and only major (magnitude > 4.5) earthquakes for the past 7 days.

All other folders and branches contain examples and use cases for mapping different geometry types in GeoJSON data using Leaflet and the Mapbox API.
